This is a beautiful site with a parallax effect that can immerse the viewer in the wonderful atmosphere of the world of Avatar.  I was very inspired by the movies "Avatar 1" and "Avatar 2", so I decided to make this art project.

I used the Swiper.js library to create it, and Photoshop to process the photos.
